# BabyTube
YouTube API usage on Swift app

## How to run the project
Clone it and run it on your emulator or device

## Why 
I made this project to practice some things using Swift, in this project there's basic usage of an API, MVC development and custom items for UITableViews, for anyone who wants to take a look for any reference. Also, I'm leaving my API_KEY in the project for Youtube API Requests.

### Ok but why the name is BabyTube
By the time I made this project I was about to have my first kid so, I was kinda exited about that and also, be practicing something that I always wanted to work with, Swift.


### Tools that I used for this project
* [Youtube API V3](http://www.youtube.com) - To retrevie the data and obtain my API key for my requests
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - To handle my HTTP requests
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) - To handle my JSON Data easier 
* [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) - To download the thumbnails asynchronously
